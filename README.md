# Tracker APP

An app designed on Flutter that I'm building to solve a problem we have in our Track and Field team: how to save our performance for both training and competition and in a later version, who will be attending a particular competition to help the coaches have a clear view on that. All of that designed to have a better experience than using an Excel Sheet. 

## Getting Started

Using Flutter V1.
